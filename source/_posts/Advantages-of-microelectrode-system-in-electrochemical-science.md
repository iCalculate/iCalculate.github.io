# Advantages of Microelectrode System in Electrochemical Science

**Electrochemical micro electrode system** as a special kind of micro-nano devices, combines traditional electrochemical and micro-nano devices disciplines, with the help of micro-nano device structure, highly controlled, easy to accurately control the advantage of traditional electrochemical system miniaturization, in electrochemical micro electrode systems, due to the electrode size is far less than the diffusion layer thickness, so with: easy to achieve stable current, electrode time constant is small, the high compatibility, high resistance solution surface diffusion is given priority to with nonlinear diffusion characteristics. Therefore, it can show its unique advantages over traditional electrochemical testing in the following directions:

## 1. Mechanism research

### 1.1 Study on the Active Mechanism of  Electrochemical Sites

The core advantage of electrochemical microelectrode system is that it is reflected in the study of reaction mechanism. Based on the controllable reaction area, the diversity of electrode material design and the unique advantages of microelectrode, the intrinsic electrochemical activity of electrode material can be characterized more intuitively.

### 1.2 Fine Modulation Strategies

In the electrochemical microelectrode system, the introduction of external regulation means is more precise and controllable. For example, the field intensity at the microelectrode can be precisely controlled when the external excitation field (such as light field, electric field and magnetic field) is introduced, so as to obtain an accurate field-effect relationship.At the same time, flexible electrode design can be used to realize micro-region doping, interface, lamination, intercalation and other structures, so as to accurately demonstrate and explain the structure-activity relationship under micro-region conditions.

###  1.3 Bridge the Theory Model and Macroscopic Structure

The macroscopic electrode structure is complex, and the prediction of its action in the electrochemical process through the theoretical calculation of the chemical structure can only reflect the utility of certain structural characteristics in the macroscopic structure. The design of the microelectrode can realize the better reduction of the theoretical model and the coherent proof of the theoretical, microscopic and macroscopic.

## 2. *in-situ* Analysis

The electrochemical microelectrode system can also be used for in-situ analysis and characterization. Thanks to the small size of the system and the fact that the reaction area is easy to locate, it can be used with a variety of traditional characterization methods through the reasonable design of reaction area encapsulation and electrode signal extraction to realize in-situ electrochemical process detection of micro-area positioning.

## 3. Collision Electrochemistry

Long Yitao, Wang Wei (NJU) et al., and Henry s. White, Allen j. Bard et al., based on microelectrodes abroad, realized the electrochemical detection of single molecule and single particle collisions, which was used to construct a monomolecular electrochemical dynamics model.
