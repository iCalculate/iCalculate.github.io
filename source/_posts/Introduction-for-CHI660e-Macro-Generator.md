# Introduction for CHI660e Macro Generator

## 1 Introduction to CHI Electrochemical Workstation Macro

You can find the Macro Command from 'Control->Macro Command'. Use this command to execute a series of other commands. This is analogous to  batch files in Windows or shell scripts in Unix/Linux and is much more flexible than the Repetitive Runs command.

### **Save**

Save macro to file for later use. The program displays the Save As dialog box so  you can name your file.

### **Run Macro**

Click this button to execute the macro. The system will verify the commands and  parameter ranges of your macro before proceeding.

### **Macro Command Editor**

Type in the desired series of commands in the editor box. Each command occupies  one line. The command is case insensitive. Space will be ignored. If a parameter  is required following the command, a colon ":" or a equal sign "=" is used to  separate the command and parameter.

## 2 About this generator--CHI660e_Macro

With this generator you can use a few simple functions to generate flexible control scripts that automatically control the instrument for repeated tests and parameter adjustments over long periods of time. The code can generate TXT file and MCR file format at the same time, TXT is easy to edit and modify, MCR format file can be directly read in the editing interface.

Take an electrochemical double layer test as an exampleï¼š

```python
file=open('output.txt','w+')    #creating a read-write text document
chi = CHI660e()    #inital the class variables
chi.init_output_txt(file)    #inital the output file
CycleNum = (0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5)  #inital scan rate list
for loop in CycleNum:
	chi.init_cv_tech(ei=-0.15, eh=-0.25, el=-0.15, v=loop)  #inital cv variables
	chi.run_cv(file, 'CV-'+str(loop), add_note=True)  #generate the code
chi.gene_mcr_file(file)     #Build your macro file. Note: it will make seek point to the end
```
